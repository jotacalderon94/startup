## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Building good habits is hardâ€”so let a PokÃ©mon cheer you on. With PokÃ©mon Habit Companion, your daily tasks (study, exercise, prayer, sleep, breakfast) level up your PokÃ©mon. Complete tasks to gain XP and health, unlock evolutions, and keep your buddy happy. Skip days and your PokÃ©mon gets sick. Itâ€™s a fun, game-like way to build consistencyâ€”powered by live updates and real PokÃ©mon data from PokeAPI.
