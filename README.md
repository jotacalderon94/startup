# Pokemon Habit Companion

The Pok√©mon Habit Companion is a gamified web application designed to help students and everyday users build consistent daily habits. Instead of checking off a boring to-do list, your progress fuels a partner Pok√©mon that gains XP, evolves, and stays healthy based on your real-world performance.

By completing simple daily tasks like studying, exercising, praying, eating breakfast, and getting enough sleep, users increase their Pok√©mon‚Äôs level and health. Skipping tasks lowers health and may make the Pok√©mon ‚Äúsick.‚Äù This makes habit-tracking feel like a game, keeping users motivated with a clear, fun feedback loop.

The app uses React (Vite) for the frontend, an Express/Node.js service for backend logic, SQLite for persistent data storage, WebSockets (Socket.IO) for real-time updates, and PokeAPI to fetch authentic Pok√©mon sprites and data. Optional integration with ZenQuotes API provides daily motivational messages alongside your pet‚Äôs progress.

## üöÄ Specification Deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Building good habits is hard‚Äîso let a Pok√©mon cheer you on. With Pok√©mon Habit Companion, your daily tasks (study, exercise, prayer, sleep, breakfast) level up your Pok√©mon. Complete tasks to gain XP and health, unlock evolutions, and keep your buddy happy. Skip days and your Pok√©mon gets sick. It‚Äôs a fun, game-like way to build consistency‚Äîpowered by live updates and real Pok√©mon data from PokeAPI.

### Design
## Rough Sketches

### Login Page
![Login Page Sketch](docs/loginSketch.png)

The login page will have an option for register and sign in, I haven't decided yet how will I deal with users, but probable I will use OAuth. That is why in the design you can see some sign in options logos.

### Dashboard Page
![Dashboard Page Sketch](docs/MainSketch.png)

The main page will have the pokemon in the middle and different features, those in the image are just to illustrate and to separate spaces, but it might change within the features and the final design. 

### Key features

- Secure login & registration.

- Task checklist with 5 daily core tasks.

- Pokemon that grows/evolves based on performance.

- Health decreases if tasks are neglected.

- Motivational quotes or fun facts from 3rd-party API.

- Real-time updates of pet stats via WebSockets.

- Persistent storage of user, pokemon-pet, and task history.

- Pok√©mon data (sprite, flavor text) from PokeAPI.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic structure for login, dashboard, and about pages.
- **CSS** - Styling pet UI, progress bars, and responsive layout.
- **React** - Components for login, task list, pet display, progress bars; React Router for navigation.
- **Service** - Backend endpoints for:
                    Register/login/logout
                    Get/update pet stats
                    Save daily tasks
                    Get motivational quotes (3rd-party API) 
- **DB/Login** - Store users, hashed passwords, pokemons, and task completions. 
- **WebSocket** - Broadcast Pokemon status changes and leaderboard updates in real time.
