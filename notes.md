# CS 260 Notes

[My startup - Simon](https://simon.cs260.click)

##Learnings

These last couples days I have learn more about aws and using ec2 instances. I was not sure about cloning the simon repo and making it work within my own link but now I was able to make it work. I am still confuse on where should I put the simon repo if in my startup repo or just in a local one. Maybe asking for clarification on those instructions would have been a good thing haha. 

9/25

I changed some stuff to make it more clear about the DB and the websocket purpose I am unsure about editing the readme file, so I will ask the TA if we can change the format or if we need to keep it.

## AWS

I dont think I want to add all the info here eventhough it is just notes, it might expose something so I know it is working and that is good haha.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

I just create an easy structure to follow later, I added some place holders for the upcoming stuff as required. 

I added some text in the about me page, with my info and repo so the TA can review it.

I will also add the 3rd party place holder

## CSS

I haven't add yet any style but I don't think this will be a huge problem. I worked with the required framework, and it was good, also I liked that there is a big library with resources, that was easy to use. 

## React Part 1: Routing

not yet
## React Part 2: Reactivity

not yet
## Testing

I dont really now how notes work because I havent used them before.  but now that I read more I have learned that those are pretty much just notes and based on what is required I will use it as my kinda journal about this project and what I've learned in classes. Now I will comit this directly from the web vers.
