# CS 260 Notes

[My startup - Simon](https://simon.cs260.click)

##Learnings

These last couples days I have learn more about aws and using ec2 instances. I was not sure about cloning the simon repo and making it work within my own link but now I was able to make it work. I am still confuse on where should I put the simon repo if in my startup repo or just in a local one. Maybe asking for clarification on those instructions would have been a good thing haha. 

9/25

I changed some stuff to make it more clear about the DB and the websocket purpose I am unsure about editing the readme file, so I will ask the TA if we can change the format or if we need to keep it.

10/1

I worked on the CSS to fix the footer, I had worked before on the style part so now it is pretty much fixing and defining some colors. 

10/7

I have been reviewing some react stuff as well as some JS, I think I will like to add some cheat sheet here with different languages to refer them in case I need it. I think I understand mostly everything however, there are times when I feel I don't remember everything so adding those here could be a good thing so if I need to double check any concept I can use this. 

10/8

In order to make the migration to react from an static page, I created 2 new branches one to keep the legacy version, and the other to do the migration, this is also to practice good practices on how it works on real environments. 

to run deploy:
./deployReact.sh -k /c/Users/jotac/Downloads/dev-server-key.pem -h habitbuddy.click -s startup

**remember to run it on bash haha

10/22 

it has been some time, today while working on deploying simon first I got confused because I wasnt able to see all the buttons on the navbar, but then I double check the authentication part which makes possible the renderization of the other part.

## AWS

I dont think I want to add all the info here eventhough it is just notes, it might expose something so I know it is working and that is good haha.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

I just create an easy structure to follow later, I added some place holders for the upcoming stuff as required. 

I added some text in the about me page, with my info and repo so the TA can review it.

I will also add the 3rd party place holder

## CSS

I haven't add yet any style but I don't think this will be a huge problem. I worked with the required framework, and it was good, also I liked that there is a big library with resources, that was easy to use. 

## React Part 1: Routing

not yet
## React Part 2: Reactivity

not yet
## Testing

I dont really now how notes work because I havent used them before.  but now that I read more I have learned that those are pretty much just notes and based on what is required I will use it as my kinda journal about this project and what I've learned in classes. Now I will comit this directly from the web vers.
